### What I learned

API integration is a cornerstone of software engineering. I was able to fetch data from various endpoints using cursor pagination, query, and body parameters. I used several JavaScript libraries and Bootstrap to create an intuitive UX/UI. I learned a lot about passing information within a complex architecture through props and look forward to incorporating custom hooks and utils in future versions.

### Continued development

Making web applications that are readable and scalable is something that I plan to make second-nature when I code. In future versions of this app, I will incorporate custom hooks and utils. I've identified four files with more than 80 lines of code. Splitting those up and creating helper files based on similar functions would help achieve cleaner code. I would also incorporate a file for error handling that would display an error message to the user. While console logs helped me to pinpoint issues, they're not the ideal method for production. Next time, I would set up error handling measures at the start of a project and incorporate them as needed.
